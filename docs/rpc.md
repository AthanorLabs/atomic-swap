# JSON-RPC API

The `swapd` program automatically starts a JSON-RPC server that can be used to interact
with the swap network and make/take swap offers.

## `net` namespace

### `net_addresses`

Get the local libp2p listening addresses of the node. Unless you have a public IP
directly attached to your host, these are not the addresses that remote hosts will
directly connect to.

Parameters:
- none

Returns:
- `addresses`: list of libp2p multiaddresses the swap daemon is currently listening on.

Example:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d \
'{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"0","method":"net_addresses","params":{}}' \
| jq .
```
```
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "addresses": [
      "/ip4/172.31.32.254/tcp/9900/p2p/12D3KooWQQWDJ7KA1Fwdf2ejWz9VXHKvY8cC5PB7Sf34fbEGbsgV",
      "/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/9900/p2p/12D3KooWQQWDJ7KA1Fwdf2ejWz9VXHKvY8cC5PB7Sf34fbEGbsgV",
      "/ip4/172.31.32.254/udp/9900/quic-v1/p2p/12D3KooWQQWDJ7KA1Fwdf2ejWz9VXHKvY8cC5PB7Sf34fbEGbsgV",

}
```

### `net_discover`

Discover peers on the network via DHT that have active swap offers.

Parameters:

  for. **Note**: Currently only `XMR` offers are supported. Default is `XMR`.
- `searchTime` (optional): time in seconds to perform the search. Default is 12s.

Returns:
- `peers`: list of lists of peers's multiaddresses. A peer may have multiple multiaddresses, so the nested list pertains to a single peer.

Example:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d \
'{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"0","method":"net_discover","params":{"searchTime":3}}' \

      ]
    ]
  },
  "id": "0"
}
```

### `net_queryAll`

Discover peers on the network via DHT that have active swap offers and gets all their swap offers.

Parameters:
- `provides` (optional): one of `ETH` or `XMR`, depending on which offer you are searching
  for. **Note**: Currently only `XMR` offers are supported. Default is `XMR`.
